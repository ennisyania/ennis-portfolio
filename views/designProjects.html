                <h2>Name Card Design</h2>
                <p>This name card is something I designed to represent 
                    me as a person and the feeling I want to convey to 
                    people with whom I want to make connections in my career. This name card was made using Canva, but I used my own layout. I decided to keep the color mostly red, using a yellowish beige to add a pop of color where needed to emphasize certain elements.
                    <br>
                    The front of the name card features a simple layout 
                    with my logo in the middle, creating a sense of focus on it and drawing the most attention, as it is balanced right in the center. The back of the card mainly required layout planning, ensuring there were margins within sections to provide some breathing room for better readability.
                    <br>
                    This project taught me how to use color to emphasize 
                    what needs emphasis and the importance of layout to 
                    ensure readability.

            <h2 id="description-2" class="description-title">City in Nature EDM</h2>
            <p>In this project, I was tasked with making an EDM for one 
                of the Singapore Green Plan pillars. In this EDM, 
                I utilized the design rule of emphasis to capture the 
                viewer's attention with the bright yellow flower. This 
                was entirely done using Illustrator, completely by me. 
                From this project, I have learned the importance of 
                colour schemes, as it was quite difficult for me to 
                choose colours that blended well together and did not 
                disrupt readability.
