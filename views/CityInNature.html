                    In this project, I was tasked with making an EDM for one
                    of the Singapore Green Plan pillars.

                <p>
                    In this EDM,
                    I utilized the design rule of emphasis to capture the
                    viewer's attention with the bright yellow flower. This
                    was entirely done using Illustrator.
                    From this project, I have learned the importance of
                    colour schemes, as it was quite difficult for me to
                    choose colours that blended well together and did not
                    disrupt readability.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I also took reference pictures of buildings in my town 
                    and sketched the flower by tracing over it to simplify 
                    the process.
